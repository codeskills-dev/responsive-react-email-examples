# Responsive-react-email-examples

A live preview for `react-email` right in your browser so you don't need to keep sending real emails during development.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Example templates are in the `/emails` directory
